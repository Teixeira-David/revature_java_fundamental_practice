/* 
--1. Challenge: Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100. 
--2. Challenge: Write a program that takes an integer input n and prints the nth prime number. For example, if n = 6, the program should output 13 (the 6th prime number).
        Hint: Use a loop and a counter to find and count prime numbers until the nth prime is reached.
            Input: n = 6
            Output: 13
--3. Challenge: Write a program that takes two integers as input, start and end, and calculates the sum of all prime numbers between them (inclusive).
        Hint: Use a nested loop for checking prime numbers within the given range and accumulate their sum.        
            Input: start = 10, end = 50
            Output: Sum of all primes between 10 and 50    
--4. Challenge: Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate and print all prime numbers between 1 and n, where n is provided by the user. 
    The algorithm should efficiently mark non-prime numbers in an array.
        Hint: Use a boolean array to track whether a number is prime and mark multiples of each prime starting from 2 as non-prime.        
            Input: n = 50
            Output: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ..., 47
--5. Challenge: Write a program that takes an integer input n and prints all the prime factors of n. For example, if n = 28, the program should output 2, 2, 7.
        Hint: Use a loop to divide the number n by its smallest prime factor repeatedly until it becomes 1.            
            Input: n = 28
            Output: 2, 2, 7
