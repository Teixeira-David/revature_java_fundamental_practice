/* 
--1. Challenge: Write a program to reverse the elements of an integer array. 
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        Output: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
--2. Challenge: Write a program to find the second largest number in an array of integers without sorting the array.
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 4, 45, 99, 6};
        Output: 45 (The second largest element)
--3. Challenge: Write a program to rotate an array to the right by k steps.
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int k = 2;
        Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
--4. Challenge: Write a program that merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array without using additional sorting.
        int[] array1 = {1, 3, 5};
        int[] array2 = {2, 4, 6};
        Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
--5. Challenge: Write a program to find the missing number in an array of consecutive integers. Assume the array contains numbers from 1 to n, with one missing.
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6};
        Output: 3 (The missing number)
            Sum = n(n+1) / 2
